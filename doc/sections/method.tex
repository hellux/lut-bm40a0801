\section{Method}
In order to find a good method, multiple methods approaches was tested
empirically. All of the tested methods are described in this chapter.

\subsubsection{Data partitioning}
As the given dataset was already split into training and test sets, no further
partitioning was performed. The training set was used for training and the test
set was used for evaluation of the classifier. The number of each class from
each dataset is listed in table \ref{tbl:datasets}.

\begin{table}[h]
    \centering
    \begin{tabular}{l|rr|r}
        class & training & test & all \\\hline
        airplane    & 484   & 243   & 727 \\
        car         & 645   & 323   & 968 \\
        cat         & 590   & 295   & 885 \\
        dog         & 468   & 234   & 702 \\
        flower      & 562   & 281   & 843 \\
        fruit       & 667   & 333   & 1000 \\
        motorbike   & 525   & 263   & 788 \\
        person      & 658   & 328   & 986 \\\hline
        all         & 4599  & 2300  & 6899

\subsubsection{Image augmentation}

\subsection{Feature Extraction}
% TODO

\subsubsection{Raw pixels}
One approach that was tested was to simply use raw pixel data as features. It
was done by converting the images to grayscale, resizing them to a fixed size
and concatenating all of the pixel intensities to a feature vector. The images
were resized to a size of 100x100 pixels resulting in 10000 features.

\subsubsection{Speeded up robust features (SURF)}

\subsubsection{AlexNet Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)}

\subsection{Training and classification}

\subsubsection{Support Vector Machine (SVM)}

\subsubsection{Self-organizing map (SOM)}
Self-organizing maps were considered as they can provide a good visualization
of the classifier which can help to analyze and improve the classification.

Classification with SOM was performed by creating and training a
two-dimensional map using the training dataset according to the SOM algorithm.
As the SOM is typically an unsupervised algorithm the labels are not used while
training the map. The labels are instead used afterwards to determine what tile
is considered what class.

Each tile of the map is considered to belong to the class that has most
classified samples for that tile. When classifying a new sample, it is placed
into a tile by using the SOM and then classified as the class of which that
tile belongs to.

The SOM has one parameter that was adjusted; the dimensions of the map. As the
problem has 8 classes the map must have at least 8 tiles to be able to
differentiate between all classes. But each class could also have more than one
tile as each class may have a set of subclasses. The dimensions was tested and
set as low as possible without losing accuracy as the higher dimension the
higher the training time is.

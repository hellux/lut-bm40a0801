\section{Introduction}
An object recognition project has been carried out by three students as part of
the course \courseName{} at \courseUniversity. Object recognition is a field of
computer vision attempting to implement software that can recognize objects in
images just like humans can do with ease.

\subsection{Task}
The task of classifying natural images of 8 different types of objects was
given to our project group. Each image contains one of the objects and the
classifier should determine which of these 8 different object the image
contains. The 8 different possible objects are airplanes, cars, cats, dogs,
flowers, fruits, motorbike and people. A labeled dataset of 6899 images was
given as well in order to train and evauluate a classifier. The dataset was
already split into training and test sets.

\subsection{Work division}
The project group consists of three students. Each student's responsibility and
contribution is listed below.
